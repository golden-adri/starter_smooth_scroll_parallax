# Starter kit with Gulp, Babel & Sass

Here is my starter with Gulp, babel, sass, and the vendors : tweenMax & jQuery.

Each tasks of Gulp are separate in the folder /js/gulp/tasks

The class Utils is useful for cross-browser utils.


## Installation
 
```
npm install
```

## Instructions

To launch all the tasks for work (js with sourcemaps) launch :
```
gulp
```

To launch all the tasks for prod (js without sourcemaps & minify css) launch :
```
gulp prod
```
